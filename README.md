# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### **This project was conceived out of sheer curiosity: to have a `React` front with `python` back**

Probably nothing special for whoever got to be taught by a senior or a team-lead, but for an autodidact - no-one's here to show me new things.

If you do have the need to check it out, you will need to have the back running, probably as a virtual environment (`venv`). Afetr that, a traditional downloand is possible, running as follows:

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
